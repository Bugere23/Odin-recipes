<h2>Description</h2>
     <p>This homemade ice cream is easy to make with just a couple of house hold ingredients: pure vanilla extract, milk, heavy whipping cream, and sugar. This American or Philadelphia-style ice cream makes for a brighter, more pronounced vanilla flavor.</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
          <p>2&#188 cups milk</p>
          <p>1 cup heavy whipping cream</p>
          <p>&#190 cup white sugar</p>
          <p>2 teaspoons vanilla extract</p>
          <p>whipped cream</p>
          <p>cyrup of your choice (caramel, chocolate etc)</p>
          
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
          <p>Stir milk, cream, and sugar in a saucepan over low heat until sugar has dissolved. Heat just until the mixture is hot and a small ring of foam appears around the edge. </p>
          <p>Transfer cream mixture to a pourable container such as a large measuring cup. Stir in vanilla extract and chill mix thoroughly, at least 2 hours. (Overnight is best.)</p>
          <p>Pour cold ice cream mix into an ice cream maker, turn on the machine, and churn according to manufacturer's directions, 20 to 25 minutes.</p>
          <p>When ice cream is softly frozen, serve immediately or place a piece of plastic wrap directly on the ice cream and place in the freezer to ripen, 2 to 3 hours.</p>
          

     </ol>
