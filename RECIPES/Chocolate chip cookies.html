    <p>These are everything a chocolate chip cookie should be. Crispy and chewy. Doughy yet fully baked. Perfectly buttery and sweet.</p>

           <p>1 cup salted butter (softened)</p>
           <p>1 cup white (granulated) sugar</p>
           <p>1 cup light brown sugar packed</p>
           <p>2 tsp pure vanilla extract</p>

           <p>3 cups all-purpose flour</p>

      </ul>

     <ol>
           <p>Preheat oven to 375 degrees F. Line a baking pan with parchment paper and set aside.</p>
           <p>In a separate bowl mix flour, baking soda, salt, baking powder. Set aside.</p>
           <p>Cream together butter and sugars until combined.</p>

           <p>Mix in the dry ingredients until combined.</p>
           <p>Add 12 oz package of chocolate chips and mix well.</p>
           <p>Roll 2-3 TBS (depending on how large you like your cookies) of dough at a time into balls and place them evenly spaced on your prepared cookie sheets. (alternately, use a small cookie scoop to make your cookies).</p>

           <p>Let them sit on the baking pan for 2 minutes before removing to cooling rack.</p>
