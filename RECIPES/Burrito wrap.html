<h2>Description</h2>
     <p>The idea for this breakfast burrito wrap came to me one day at noon when I was looking at the leftovers I had in the fridge. I saw a tortilla and it was decided – I’m gonna wrap everything I had in it and turn it into a delicious late breakfast (I don’t have big appetite in the morning, so for me this was my first meal for that day).</p>
<h2>Ingredients</h2>
     <ul>
          <p>2 Eggs</p>
          <p>1 Jalapeno</p>
          <p>1 tbsp cream cheese</p>
          <p>1 tbsp tomato paste</p>
          <p>1 garlic clove</p>
          <p>&#8531 cup spinach</p>
          <p>&#188 avocado, large</p>
          <p>1 scallion, thinly sliced</p>
          <p>2 heaping tbsp mozzarella cheese</p>
          <p>2 tsp olive oil</p>
          <p>sausage (optiona;)</p>
          <p>tortilla, large</p>
          
    </ul>
<h2>Steps</h2>
     <ol>
          <p>Scramble the eggs lightly in a non-stick pan. </p>
          <p>Mix the tomato paste, 1 tsp olive oil, the cream cheese and garlic (optional) to form a creamy spread. Spread this over the tortilla. If desired cook a sausage as well. Tip: wipe the pan clean, so that you can use it to toast the burrito.</p>
          <p>Put all the rest of the ingredients in the tortilla, except olive oil and wrap the burrito.</p>
          <p>Toast on the folded side first at medium high heat with olive oil, so that the ends “seal”. Do this until golden brown, flip and toast on the other side as well.</p>
          <p>Transfer to a cutting board and slice carefully in the middle. Serve immediately!</p>
          
     </ol>
